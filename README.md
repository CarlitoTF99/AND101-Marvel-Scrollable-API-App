# AND101 Project 5 - Choose Your Own API

Submitted by: Jose Huertero

Time spent: 8 hours spent in total

## Summary

Marvel Project 5 API is an android app that displays an image, character name and character description once the user inputs the name of the super hero they are looking for.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be:‚åöü¶π‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüì±

## Notes
This app was quite challenging to complete using the Marvel API, there were a lot of issues with going through the Json file and pulling out the right data from it by navigating through the different keys.
I also came across an issue with the Glide feature because the Http was not secured then it was giving me and issue and it took me a white to debug it and find out that security was in fact the issue. I managed to solve 
this problem by simply changing the URL of every image to Https using the .replace("http://", "https://") fuction. I added a EditeText box where the user could input the type of super hero that wants to request from the API, 
this name which it would be a key then will request the path which is the picture, description, and name of the super hero input by the user.
