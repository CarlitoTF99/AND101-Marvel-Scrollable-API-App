# AND101 Project 7 - CYOAPI Part 3: Beautified

Submitted by: Jose Huertero

Time spent: 4 hours spent in total

## Summary

Marvel App API is an android app that is an app that displays a list of marvel characters in decending order from A-Z with their name, photo and description. 

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüì±üòÅ

## Notes

This project was very straigh foward, I just added new fonts to better git that commic look and I dowloaded them from google since the ones in the Android Studio library were not so good for my UI.
I also added features to my themes and drawables to again, make it better fit the comic book look.
